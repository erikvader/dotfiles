#+STARTUP: overview

* concat clips
must have same resolution and bitrate and stuff
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i files.txt -c copy output.avi
#+END_SRC
=-safe 0= makes sure that ffmpeg doesn't complain on files with spaces in their filenames and stuff.

files.txt is on the form:
#+BEGIN_VERBATIM
file '/path/to/file1'
file '/path/to/file2'
#+END_VERBATIM
man page =ffmpeg-formats(1)= for more info on concat.
* split clips
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -ss start -map 0 -c copy -to end out.mkv
#+END_SRC
- =-ss= is start time
- =-to= is end time. Can alternatively be =-t= so specify duration instead.
Times can be expressed as =[HH:]MM:SS= or =S[.m]=.
* convert audio to mp3
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ffmpeg -i inputfile -codec:a libmp3lame -q:a 0 -c:v copy -map_metadata 0 -id3v2_version 3 outputfile.mp3
#+END_SRC
- =-q:a 0= sets the highest quality
- =-c:v copy= transfers album covers
- =-map_metadata 0= transfers album artist and stuff
- =-id3v2_version 3= sets version of id3v2 (why do i have this?)
