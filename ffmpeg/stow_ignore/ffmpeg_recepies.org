#+STARTUP: overview

* concat clips
must have same resolution and bitrate and stuff
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i files.txt -c copy output.avi
#+END_SRC
=-safe 0= makes sure that ffmpeg doesn't complain on files with spaces in their filenames and stuff.

files.txt is on the form:
#+BEGIN_VERBATIM
file '/path/to/file1'
file '/path/to/file2'
#+END_VERBATIM
man page =ffmpeg-formats(1)= for more info on concat.
* split clips
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ffmpeg -ss start -to end -i input.mkv -map 0 -c copy out.mkv
#+END_SRC
- =-ss= is start time
- =-to= is end time. Can alternatively be =-t= so specify duration instead.
Times can be expressed as =[HH:]MM:SS= or =S[.m]=.
As input option means when to stop and start reading from the input
and as output option means when to stop or start writing to the output
file.

If you cut with stream copy (-c copy) you need to use the
=-avoid_negative_ts make_zero= option if you want to use that segment
with the â€‹concat demuxer ([[https://stackoverflow.com/a/41032346][explanation)]]. Searches won't be precise
either, it will use the closest keyframe (when copying??).
* convert audio to mp3
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ffmpeg -i inputfile -codec:a libmp3lame -q:a 0 -c:v copy -map_metadata 0 -id3v2_version 3 outputfile.mp3
#+END_SRC
- =-q:a 0= sets the highest quality
- =-c:v copy= transfers album covers by copying (it re-encodes it otherwise i think, which is probably not necessary)
- =-map_metadata 0= transfers album artist and stuff (flag not necessary, it copies everything by default)
- =-id3v2_version 3= sets version of id3v2 (why do i have this?)
* mux clips
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ffmpeg -i hej1.mkv -i hej2.mkv -map 0 -map -0:a:1 -map 1:a:0 -c copy out.mkv
#+END_SRC
This will copy all streams from the first file except for one of it's
audio streams which will be replaced with one audio stream from the
second file. All streams' metadata is copied by default and the global
metadata from the first input file is copied as global metadata for
the output file (i think).
* mp4
TODO: verify
mp4 sometimes has some special data streams (I think) that needs to be
ignored with =-map -0:d=

mp4 doesn't support all kinds of subtitle formats, so they need to be
converted with =-c:s mov_text=.
